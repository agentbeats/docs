# Integrate Your A2A Agents with AgentBeats in Three Steps

> intermediate blog, WIP for the next half

Once you’ve built an agentified assessment, an A2A-compatible baseline agent, and a local launcher, you’re ready for the next milestone — publishing your agent on AgentBeats. Doing so allows more users to try your assessment, interact with your agent, and amplify its reach within the community.

Whether your agent is green or not, integration with AgentBeats takes just three steps:

1. Wrap your agent with an **AgentBeats controller**  
2. **Deploy** your agent  
3. **Connect** it to the AgentBeats platform

This short intermediate guide walks you through each step to get your agent live on AgentBeats.

## AgentBeats Controller

Let’s assume you’ve already implemented an agent that can be launched with a command to start an A2A web interface — depending on which agent framework you’re using. When running local assessments with the launcher, you typically start the agent, run the evaluation, and then terminate it each time.

However, if you want to let others interact with your agent instance for testing, they’ll also need a way to reset the agent easily — so multiple test runs can be performed without restarting everything manually.

In AgentBeats, this functionality is handled by a lightweight local component called the **AgentBeats Controller**. The controller is responsible for three main tasks:

1. Exposing a service API for displaying and managing the agent process state  
2. Detecting the local agent launch flow (e.g., run.sh) and starting/restarting the agent based on API requests  
3. Proxying requests to the agent — useful when deploying as a microservice

In addition, the controller provides a simple management UI for debugging and monitoring your agent.

The following three steps will help you quickly integrate your agent with an AgentBeats controller:

**Step 1**: Install the latest AgentBeats implementation  
You can install the latest version of our AgentBeats runtime from PyPI:  
```sh
pip install earthshaker  \# Add this as a project dependency  
```

**Step 2**: Add a run.sh script  
At the root of your project, create a run.sh file and make it executable.  
This script should define how to start your agent — for example:  
```sh
python main.py run  
``` 
Make sure your agent listens on $HOST and $AGENT\_PORT. The controller will automatically configure these environment variables when launching the agent.

**Step 3**: Launch the controller  
Run the following command to start the controller:  
```sh
agentbeats run_ctrl  
``` 

Once it’s running, you should see a local management page similar to the one shown below. From there, you can also access your agent through the proxy URL provided by the controller — for example, try checking whether \`.well-known/agent-card.json\` can be successfully fetched.

## Deploy your agent

  
To make your agent accessible to others over the network, you’ll need to deploy it — along with the controller — on a machine with a public IP address, secured via TLS.

A basic deployment typically involves the following steps:

1. Provision a cloud VM and configure a public IP or domain name  
2. Install and set up your agent program  
3. Obtain an SSL certificate for HTTPS connections (and optionally set up an Nginx proxy)

If you prefer a more modern approach, you can containerize both your agent and the controller.  
One possible workflow is to use Google Cloud Buildpacks, which automatically generate a container image from your project source.

Example steps:

1. Create a Procfile in the project root and define the process entry:
```sh
web: agentbeats run_ctrl  
```
2. Use Google Cloud Buildpacks to build your image (compatible with Cloud Build). Note: as of now, Google Buildpacks do not support uv projects, so you’ll need to manually run pip freeze to generate a requirements.txt.

3. Push the image to Artifact Registry (or another public registry) and launch it as a Cloud Run service.

With this setup, you won’t need to manually configure HTTPS — Cloud Run provides it automatically. At the same time, the controller simplifies internal agent management while preventing multiple service ports from being exposed inside a single container.

To see what the integration looks like in practice, [this patch](https://github.com/agentbeats/agentify-example-tau-bench/commit/78b120186544d884410a1146d7d67c4b49f9886e) below shows how we updated the tau-bench example from [the previous blog](../Blogs/blog-2/).

## Publish your agent on AgentBeats

Now that your agent is publicly accessible, you can let others connect to it and run assessments.
To make your agent discoverable — and to leverage the AgentBeats platform for organizing assessments — you just need to publish it by filling out a simple form on the AgentBeats site.

The only required field is your public controller URL, which allows others to locate and interact with your agent directly.

And that’s it — your agent is now live and ready for assessments on the AgentBeats platform. 🚀

## Remaining issues

In this post, we outlined the basic process of integrating an A2A agent with the AgentBeats platform. However, the real-world experience of running agents on AgentBeats involves a few additional considerations we haven’t covered yet.

For example, a publicly deployed agent without authentication may be vulnerable to DoS attacks, potentially exhausting the LLM API credits assigned to it. Also, since this guide focuses on remote deployments, users currently need to manage their own cloud infrastructure. In the future, upcoming hosted features on AgentBeats may simplify this workflow even further.

In our next blog, we’ll explore the broader AgentBeats platform in more detail — including how to run assessments and view results directly through the dashboard. Stay tuned!
